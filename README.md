# Weather Forecast App

The **Weather Forecast App** is a basic front-end application that fetches real-time weather data using a weather API. Users can enter a city name to get current weather information such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. The app utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a clean and responsive user interface, making it easy for users to view weather updates instantly. This project demonstrates proficiency in API integration and front-end development, providing practical experience in handling asynchronous data and dynamic content rendering.
